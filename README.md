# Szalkalkulator
Szálanyag vágás kalkulátor

This project is a simple tool, for calculating cutting pattern for stock materials (pipes, closed sections, etc.).
Currently under active(?) development; especially the gui needs refinement and translation.

Prevoius working versions of this tool are avalaiable under the releases tab, with terminal interface and without some minor features.

Any help is appreciated!

Todos:
- refactor tkinter gui to pyqt
- add calculated stock images to printed pdf, instead of raw text
- refine existing gui elements and add new (statusbar)
