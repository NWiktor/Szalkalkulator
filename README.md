# Szalkalkulator
Sz치lanyag v치g치s kalkul치tor

This project is a simple tool, for calculating cutting pattern for stock materials (pipes, closed sections, etc.).
Currently under active(?) development; especially the gui needs refinement and translation.

Any help is appreciated!

Todos:
- refactor tkinter gui to pyqt
- add calculated stock images to printed pdf, instead of raw text
- refine existing gui elements and add new (statusbar)
